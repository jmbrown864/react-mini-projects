# React Mini Projects Overview

This is my space for practicing React. Anything from interviews, to coding foundations, to figuring out smaller pieces of larger projects.

To see a "mini" in action, import and initialize the mini's component in `App.js`.

## Available Minis:

### Color Palette

A color palette generator.

### Counter
